# Cat vs Dog Detection using YOLOv5

## Description
A simple object detection project that identifies cats and dogs in images. Built with Python, PyTorch and YOLOv5, this demo shows how to preprocess data, train a model and run inference on new images.

## Technologies
- Python  
- PyTorch  
- YOLOv5  
- Google Colab  

## Data
Download the Cat vs Dog dataset from Kaggle and unpack it into `data/images/`  
- Dataset: [Dogs vs. Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)  
- Place `train.zip` contents under `data/images/train/` and `test1.zip` under `data/images/test/`
## Colab Notebook
A ready-to-run notebook is provided for quick experimentation on Google Colab:  
- Open in Colab:
  - The notebook includes steps to:  
1. Mount Google Drive (optional)  
2. Install requirements  
3. Download/unzip Kaggle data  
4. Prepare path data  
5. Launch training and view results  


## Setup & Installation
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ThanhDT127/Cat_Dog_yolov5.git
   cd Cat_Dog_yolov5
